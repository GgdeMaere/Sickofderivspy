# Sickofderivspy

Sickofderivspy is supposed to make life easier when computing errors on data. It is made to do what I need it to do and work with what I work with (mostly numpy), but if it can help you be my guest. Yes, I know it's probably very ugly, not efficient and simply not the right way to do things.

It has not been tested very thoroughly yet.

For a basic idea on how to run it, look at the example.py file.
